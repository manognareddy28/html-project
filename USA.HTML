 Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at Jamaica Hospital in the borough of Queens, New York City. His father was Frederick Christ Trump,
 a Bronx-born real estate developer whose parents were German immigrants. His mother was Scottish-born housewife Mary Anne MacLeod Trump.
 Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.
 At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school. In 1964, he enrolled at Fordham University.
 Two years later he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.
 Profiles of Trump published in The New York Times in 1973 and 1976 erroneously reported that he had graduated first in his class at Wharton,
 but he had never made the school's honor roll. In 2015, Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen threatened Fordham University
 and the New York Military Academy with legal action if they released Trump's academic records.
